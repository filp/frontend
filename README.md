# frontend

A minimal but opinionated quick start template for frontend projects.

## Components:

- Webpack
- Typescript
- React, React Router, React Query
- Emotion for styled components

## Getting started:

1. Clone this repository

```shell
$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:filp/frontend.git your-project-name
```

2. Install dependencies

```shell
$ cd frontend
$ yarn
```

3. Start the development server

```shell
$ yarn serve
```

4. You're ready to go!

## Things you may want to do next:

- Review `webpack.config.js` - it's a good start, but probably won't fit your needs exactly
- Setup your test process
- Update `package.json` with your project's name and description
